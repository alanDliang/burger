This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS.
Backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name to add it to the mene. This then adds the new burger entry into the MySQL database using JawsDB.
The initial burger entry is added & placed on the left side of the screen. 
The user may then eat any burger by clicking on it, which moves it into the adjacent column and updates its status accordingly in the database.
